## 🔢 **How Calculations Work**

### **Standard Drink:**
- 1 standard drink = 14g pure alcohol
- ≈ 120 calories average (varies by type)

### **Weight Loss Impact:**
```
Weekly Impact = (Daily Drinks × 120 cal × 7 days) / 7700 cal
Monthly Impact = Weekly Impact × 4.33

Example:
- 2 drinks/day × 120 cal = 240 cal/day
- 240 × 7 = 1,680 cal/week
- 1,680 / 7,700 = 0.22 kg/week slower weight loss
- 0.22 × 4.33 = 0.95 kg/month slower
```

### **Correlation Calculation:**
- Uses Pearson correlation coefficient
- Compares alcohol consumption vs weight changes
- Identifies positive/negative relationships
- Shows strength of correlation (0-100%)
